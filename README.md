# Twitter-Text-Bot
Bot that makes text tweets to Twitter
This Bot is currently in-the-works. 
The bot will be using the Tweepy Framework to interact with Twitter's API.

Tweets for this bot are stored locally. The same rules for standard tweets still apply.
Responses should be under <140 characters and the responses must be text only

[RUNNING THE BOT] The bot is automatically exectued on a crontab. If you are not familiar with crontabs, you can read about them here http://crontab.org/ Additionally, here is a generator for convenience-sake http://crontab-generator.org/

[RULES] These arent exactly rules made by me, but I do follow them. They're the universal way of maintianing good bot etiquette

-Don’t @mention people who haven’t opted in -Don’t follow Twitter users who haven’t opted in -Don’t use a pre-existing hashtag -Don’t go over your rate limits

As I said before, making the bot was actually really fun despite being slightly frustrating. I do genuinely recommened programming your own, and if you find trouble, you can refer to this repo as a base. Good luck!
