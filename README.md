# Twitter-Text-Bot
Bot that makes text tweets to Twitter
This Bot is currently in-the-works. 
The bot will be using the Tweepy Framework to interact with Twitter's API.

Tweets for this bot are stored locally. The same rules for standard tweets still apply.
Responses should be under <140 characters and the responses must be text only
